#labels Featured,OnlineJudge

= Introduction =

This plugin is designed for courses involving programming. It can automatically grade programming assignments by testing the submissions by customizable test cases ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest ACM-ICPC]/[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_judge Online Judge] style). 
= Features = 

This plugin inherent Moodle's standard assignment type, uploadsingle . So it gets all uploadsingle functions and has its own additional features:

  * Support both Linux and Windows.
  * Run C/C++ code locally under sophisticated [http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsandbox/ libsandbox] environment to prevent attacks (e.g. rebooting system, accessing files/network, consuming/occupying system resources). (Linux only)
  * Run C/C++, Java, C#, Python, php, schema and other 40+ languages remotely in [http://ideone.com]. It is safe and free.
  * Different results (e.g. Accept, Wrong Answer, Presentation Error, Compilation Error, Time/Memory/Output Limit Exceed) get different grade. 
  * Support multiply test cases.
  * Grade test cases separately. E.g., there are four cases and max grade of each is 25. The student pass three of them can get 25+25+25 = 75.
  * Customized feedback/hint can be shown to who doesn't pass the test.
  * Compile only mode.
  * Teachers can trigger rejudge of all submissions and grade manually anytime.
  * Support resubmit many times and one time submit.
  * More details (program output and etc.) can be shown to teachers.
  * Highlight code preview (powered by [http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter SyntaxHighlighter]).
  * Easy installation, no root required.
  * Translation: English and Simplified Chinese
