In the installation step 2, make sandbox, use "make policy1" instead of "make" and resubmit the assignment.

If the problem is still there, use "make policy2" and resubmit.

If the problem is still there, do the following:

{{{
uname -a
gcc -v
cd /path/to/moodle/mod/assignment/type/onlinejudge/
./languages/c.sh simple.c a.out   #use ./languages/cpp.sh for C++ code
./sandbox/sand a.out              # Your program will run or be broken by sandbox
echo $?
}}}

Ensure that the last command output 2, run your program as:

{{{
strace ./a.out
}}}

Send simple.c, a.out and the output of all the above commands to sunner@gmail.com . I can make a special patch for your system.
