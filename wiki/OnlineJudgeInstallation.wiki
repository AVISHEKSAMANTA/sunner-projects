== 5. Make Judge Work==

This plug-in uses daemon or [http://docs.moodle.org/en/Cron moodle cron job] to judge submissions. There are three different ways to make the judge work. The first is the most recommended and the last is the least recommended. 

=== 5.1. Create Judge Daemon Through Cron ===

If you can setup your moodle's [http://docs.moodle.org/en/Cron cron job] be called by php cli, this is your best choice for convenience. That means in crontab, put a command which is similar with: 

{{{
php -q /PATH/TO/MOODLE/admin/cron.php
}}}

That's all! The daemon will be created automatically. Use

{{{
ps -FC php
}}}

to ensure the daemon is running.

[http://docs.moodle.org/en/Cron] has more details about how to setup cron job.

=== 5.2. Create Judge Daemon in Command Line===

If you'd like or have to trigger cron through http, this is your best choice.

In command line, run the following command to create daemon:

{{{
php -q /PATH/TO/MOODLE/mod/assignment/type/onlinejudge/judged.php
}}}

Use

{{{
ps -FC php
}}}

to ensure the daemon is running.

You'd better to make the script as an autorun command through adding it into /etc/rc.local or other ways. Please reference your system's manual for how to configure autorun command.

=== 5.3. Judge Through Cron Job ===

Well, in this way, there always is a delay between submitting and judge. Tell the students to be patient.

First, make sure the [http://docs.moodle.org/en/Cron moodle cron job] works.

In config.php, add the following line of code:

{{{
$CFG->assignment_oj_judge_in_cron = true;
}}}

That's all.
